# Accessibility-alpha
Starter for UI adhering to universal design principles.

Goals
Quick startup with a bootstrap theme that addresses:
- contrast
- semantic page mockups using individual components
- navigation examples using multi-device common denominators
- address structure for site directory (MVC?) 
- naming conventions guidelines (images, classes, filenames, directory names) etc that respects semantic, seo, accessiblity, and optimal performance. 
- Font stack to accommodate more wisened vision
